###A repo for John, Robert, and Max to play around and learn some cool stuff.

What I understand so far is that you are both more familiar with Python than Java and that you'd like to practice web development.  For those purposes I'll provide a brief overview of what I'll set us up to play with.  I'll just assume nothing and be thorough in explanation.  A webapp requires a lot of pieces to get going so here's the general outline of each component:

####Back-end:
* Python
* Java

####Framework:
* Django (Python)
* Spring (Java)

####Database:
* SQL

####Server-side Requests:
* PHP

####Client-side Request:
* JavaScript

####Front-end:
* HTML & CSS
