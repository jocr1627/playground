###A repo for John, Robert, and Max to play around and learn some cool stuff.

What I understand so far is that you are both more familiar with Python than Java and that you'd like to practice web development.  For those purposes I'll provide a brief overview of what I'll set us up to play with.  I'll just assume nothing and be thorough in explanation.  I start by providing some stuff for Python migrate into Java.  A webapp requires a lot of pieces to get going so here's the general outline of each component:

####Back-end:
* Python
* Java

####Framework:
* Django (Python)
* Spring (Java)

####Database:
* SQL

####Server-side Requests:
* PHP

####Client-side Request:
* JavaScript

####Front-end:
* HTML & CSS

##Getting Started:

1. So for starters I'll make sure you have the right stuff for python.  If you don't already use Anaconda, then go to (http://continuum.io/downloads) and install it.  Basically, it puts all the libraries you need for Python onto your machine and makes it easier to install more in the future.  Once you have Anaconda then you'll have the Anaconda Command Prompt.  If you use Mac then you can also just use bash, or if Windows you can use PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt.
2. From your desired shell, you can type the command:
'''
ipython notebook
'''
This should produce the following output:
