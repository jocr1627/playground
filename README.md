# playground
A repo for John, Robert, and Max to play around and learn some cool stuff.

What I understand so far is that you are both more familiar with Python than Java and that you'd like to practice web development.  For those purposes I'll provide a brief overview of what I'll set us up to play with.  I'll just assume nothing and be thorough in explanation.  A webapp requires a lot of pieces to get going so here's the general outline of each component with some example options:

##Back-end:
Python
Java
Ruby

##Framework:
Django (Python)
Spring (Java)
Rails (Ruby)

##Database:
SQL

##Server:


##Server-side Requests:
PHP

##Client-side Request:
JavaScript

##Front-end:
HTML
CSS
