###A repo for John, Robert, and Max to play around and learn some cool stuff.

What I understand so far is that you are both more familiar with Python than Java and that you'd like to practice web development.  For those purposes I'll provide a brief overview of what I'll set us up to play with.  I'll just assume nothing and be thorough in explanation.  I start by providing some stuff for Python migrate into Java.  A webapp requires a lot of pieces to get going so here's the general outline of each component:

####Back-end:
* Python
* Java

####Framework:
* Django (Python)
* Spring (Java)

####Database:
* SQL

####Server-side Requests:
* PHP

####Client-side Request:
* JavaScript

####Front-end:
* HTML & CSS

##Getting Started:

###Python
1. So for starters I'll make sure you have the right stuff for python.  If you don't already use Anaconda, then go to http://continuum.io/downloads and install it.  Basically, it puts all the libraries you need for Python onto your machine and makes it easier to install more in the future.  Once you have Anaconda then you'll have the Anaconda Command Prompt.  If you use Mac then you can also just use bash, or if Windows you can use PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt.
2. From your desired shell, you can type the command "ipython notebook.  This should produce the following output:
![Alt text](https://github.com/jocr1627/playground/blob/master/images/screenshots/notebook.png)
3. This will then automatically open a page in your browser that looks like this:
![Alt text](https://github.com/jocr1627/playground/blob/master/images/screenshots/notebook-browser.png)
It opens inside the directory you had your shell set to.  In my case, you see that it contains the "images" folder because I opened inside a directory containing that folder.  You can click inside those folders and navigate deeper from where you started.  You can also import files from other locations in your file system.  If you click the "New Notebook" in the top right, you'll open a page where you can code some Python.  You can write blocks of code then press "Shift-Enter" as a hotkey to run the selected one.  You can run them in any order you like.  This a great way to write quickly in Python.  Go play around with it if this is something you haven't used!

###Java
1. In order to get going on Java you're going to want Eclipse.  This is a handy-dandy plugin based IDE that can do just about everything you'd ever need for Java.  It'll manage your git and your projects and your imports.  Go here https://eclipse.org/downloads/ to install it.
2. Running Eclipse will prompt you for a workspace location.  Direct it to any folder where you want to store your code (you need to make a new folder just for the project you want to work on, such as "C:/Users/user_id/dev/playground-eclipse").
3. Once you open an Eclipse workspace and you close the annoying help page you'll have a project explorer pane on your left.  Create a new project (you'll get a big long list of project types- select "Java Project").  Naming conventions for a project are reverse url with '.' characters between divisions (eg. com.robert.statistics).  Create a package inside your "src" folder.  Same naming applies here (com.robert.statistics.ui or com.robert.statistics.methods).  From there you should create Java files and play around.  There's a big green arrow to run programs with at the top and a fantastic debugger in Eclipse.

I'll leave it at that for now.  I'll create a "Python" directory and a "Java" directory containing some stuff I think is interesting and some examples of each.  Hopefully this is enough to get you guys going if you didn't already have any of it!  Just want to make sure you have something good to work with for each. HTML & CSS are simpler to get going and don't require much so I'll throw in some stuff for that too.  If you want an editor tool you can definitely use Eclipse or better download something lightweight such as Sublime http://www.sublimetext.com/2.  Let me know if there's something in particular you guys would like to try/learn/make!  We can also always put open source projects onto this Git and do our own modifications (eg. Minecraft).
